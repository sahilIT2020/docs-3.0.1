# AppAuth Android

## Overview
AppAuth for Android is a client SDK for communicating with OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect providers. It strives to directly map the requests and responses of those specifications, while following the idiomatic style of the implementation language. In addition to mapping the raw protocol flows, convenience methods are available to assist with common tasks like performing an action with fresh tokens.

## Download
You can download (or clone) project from our [Github Repo](https://github.com/GluuFederation/AppAuth-Android)

## Specification
### Supported Android Versions
AppAuth supports Android API 16 (Jellybean) and above.

When a Custom Tabs implementation is provided by a browser on the device (for example 
by [Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/multidevice/android/customtabs)), Custom Tabs 
are used for authorization requests. Otherwise, the default browser is used as a fallback.

## Building the Project
### Prerequisites
The project requires the Android SDK for API level 23 (Marshmallow) to build, though 
the produced binaries only require API level 16 (Jellybean) to be used.

### Building from Android Studio
In AndroidStudio, File -> New -> Import project. Select the root folder (the one with 
the build.gradle file).

If you get an error like: Error:Could not find com.android.support:customtabs:23.2.0. 
then be sure you have installed the Android Support Library from the Android SDK Manager.
 Follow the Android Studio prompts to resolve the dependencies automatically.

## Requirements
To use AppAuth we need three parameters: issuer, clientId and redirectUri:

- issuer - from which the configuration will be discovered
- clientId - from dynamic client registration response
- redirectUri - this scheme must be registered as a scheme in the project's manifest file

## Dynamic Client Registration
You need to perform dynamic client registration to authorization server by providing 
following values in "Dynamic Client Registration" form:
- Registration Endpoint: YOUR_REGISTRATION_ENDPOINT
- Redirect URIs (space-separated): YOUR_REDIRECT_URI
- Response Types: CODE
- Grant Types: AUTHORIZATION_CODE
- Application Type: NATIVE

After successfull registration, it will return client id which will use for Authorization.

## Configure the Demo App
Authorization services can be added to the demo app by defining instances of
 `IdentityProvider`. Assuming a service named `myprovider`, the following steps need 
 to be taken:
 
1. The name of the service should be defined in `myprovider_name` in 
`idp_configs_optional.xml`.

2. If the service supports OpenID Connect, `myprovider_discovery_uri` would be defined 
in `idp_configs_optional.xml` and set to the discovery URI for the 
service (e.g. `https://www.myprovider.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`).
    
    Otherwise, `myprovider_auth_endpoint_uri` and `myprovider_token_endpoint_uri` 
    would be defined in `idp_configs_optional.xml` and set to the authorization and token
     endpoint URIs respectively. 

3. The default scope string, `myprovider_scope_string`, should be defined in 
`idp_configs_optional.xml`.

4. A placeholder for the client ID, `myprovider_client_id`, should be defined in 
`idp_configs.xml`.

5. The redirect URI, `myprovider_redirect_uri`, can be defined in `idp_configs.xml`.

6. An on-off toggle, `myprovider_enabled`, should be defined in `idp_configs.xml` and 
set to false by default.

7. Button resources representing the IDP should be imported into the relevant directories
 under res.

This may result in an addition to `idp_configs.xml` that looks like

```
<bool name="myprovider_enabled">true</bool>
<string name="myprovider_client_id" translatable="false">YOUR_CLIENT_ID</string>
<string name="myprovider_redirect_uri" translatable="false">https://demo.myprovider.com/callback</string>
```

And an addition to `idp_configs_optional.xml` that looks like:

```
<string name="myprovider_name">MyProvider</string>
<string name="myprovider_scope_string">profile payment location</string>
<string name="myprovider_auth_endpoint_uri">https://www.myprovider.com/auth</string>
<string name="myprovider_token_endpoint_uri">https://www.myprovider.com/token</string>
<string name="myprovider_discovery_uri">https://www.myprovider.com/.well-known/openid-configuration</string>
```

With these properties defined, a new instance of IdentityProvider can be 
defined in `IdentityProvider`:

```
public static final IdentityProvider MYPROVIDER = new IdentityProvider(
    "MyProvider", // name of the provider, for debug strings
    R.bool.myprovider_enabled,
    NOT_SPECIFIED, // discovery document not provided
    R.string.myprovider_auth_endpoint_uri,
    R.string.myprovider_token_endpoint_uri,
    NOT_SPECIFIED, // dynamic registration not supported
    R.string.myprovider_client_id,
    R.string.myprovider_auth_redirect_uri,
    R.string.myprovider_scope_string,
    R.drawable.btn_myprovider, // your button image asset
    R.string.myprovider_name,
    android.R.color.black // text color on the button
);
```

And add to `IdentityProvider`'s static list of IDPs, e.g.:

```
public static final List<IdentityProvider> PROVIDERS = Arrays.asList(MYPROVIDER)
```

Finally you need to add a new intent-filter to the 
`net.openid.appauth.RedirectUriReceiverActivity` activity section of the 
`AndroidManifest.xml`

```
<!-- Callback from authentication screen -->
<activity android:name="net.openid.appauth.RedirectUriReceiverActivity">
   
!-- redirect URI for your new IDP -->
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW"/>
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT"/>
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE"/>
        <data android:scheme="@string/your_idp_auth_redirect_scheme"/>
    </intent-filter>
</activity>
```

Make sure you've set `myauth_enabled` to true in the config, and your new IdP
should show up in the list.

## Auth Flow

AppAuth supports both manual interaction with the Authorization Server where you 
need to perform your own token exchanges, as well as convenience methods that perform 
some of this logic for you. This example uses the convenience method which returns 
either an `AuthState` object, or an error.

### Tracking authorization state

`AuthState` is a class that keeps track of the authorization and token requests and 
responses, and provides a convenience method to call an API with fresh tokens. This is 
the only object that you need to serialize to retain the authorization state of 
the session.Typically, one would do this by storing the authorization state in 
SharedPreferences or some other persistent store private to the app:

```java
@NonNull public AuthState readAuthState() {
  SharedPreferences authPrefs = getSharedPreferences("auth", MODE_PRIVATE);
  String stateJson = authPrefs.getString("stateJson");
  AuthState state;
  if (stateStr != null) {
    return AuthState.fromJsonString(stateJson);
  } else {
    return new AuthState();
  }
}

public void writeAuthState(@NonNull AuthState state) {
  SharedPreferences authPrefs = getSharedPreferences("auth", MODE_PRIVATE);
  authPrefs.edit()
      .putString("stateJson", state.toJsonString())
      .apply();
}
```

### Configuration

You can configure communication with your chosen authorization server by
specifying the endpoints directly:

```java
AuthorizationServiceConfiguration config =
        new AuthorizationServiceConfiguration(name, mAuthEndpoint, mTokenEndpoint);

// perform the auth request...
```

Or through discovery:

```java
final Uri issuerUri = Uri.parse("https://accounts.google.com");
AuthorizationServiceConfiguration config;

AuthorizationServiceConfiguration.fetchFromIssuer(
    issuerUri,
    new RetrieveConfigurationCallback() {
      @Override public void onFetchConfigurationCompleted(
          @Nullable AuthorizationServiceConfiguration serviceConfiguration,
          @Nullable AuthorizationException ex) {
        if (ex != null) {
            Log.w(TAG, "Failed to retrieve configuration for " + issuerUri, ex);
        } else {
            // service configuration retrieved, proceed to authorization...
        }
      }
  });
```

Additionally, AppAuth provides additional client configuration, in order to
control the browsers that can be used for the authorization flow, or to
control the HttpURLConnection implementation that is used for token
exchange. This can be done by creating an `AppAuthConfiguration` object:

```java
AppAuthConfiguration appAuthConfig = new AppAuthConfiguration.Builder()
    .setBrowserMatcher(new BrowserWhitelist(
        VersionedBrowserMatcher.CHROME_CUSTOM_TAB,
        VersionedBrowserMatcher.SAMSUNG_CUSTOM_TAB))
    .setConnectionBuilder(new ConnectionBuilder() {
      public HttpURLConnection openConnect(Uri uri) throws IOException {
        URL url = new URL(uri.toString());
        HttpURLConnection connection =
            (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
        if (connection instanceof HttpsUrlConnection) {
          HttpsURLConnection connection = (HttpsURLConnection) connection;
          connection.setSSLSocketFactory(MySocketFactory.getInstance());
        }
      }
    })
    .build();
```

This configuration will only permit Chrome or Samsung Browser to be used as
a custom tab for authorization flows, and changes the SSL socket factory to
a hypothetical custom version `MySocketFactory`. The modification of the
socket factory is useful for certificate pinning, or adding some additional
certificates to the trusted set (such as for testing).

This configuration is provided to `AuthorizationService` upon construction:

```java
new AuthorizationService(context, appAuthConfig);
```

### Authorizing

After configuring or retrieving an authorization service configuration,
an authorization request can be constructed for dispatch:

```java
AuthorizationRequest req = new AuthorizationRequest.Builder(
    config,
    clientId,
    ResponseTypeValues.CODE,
    redirectUri)
    .build();
```

Requests are dispatched with the help of `AuthorizationService`. As this
will open a custom tab or browser instance to fulfill this request.
An intent can be specified for both completion and cancelation of the
authorization flow:

```java
AuthorizationService service = new AuthorizationService(context);
Intent postAuthIntent = new Intent(context, MyAuthResultHandlerActivity.class);
Intent authCanceledIntent = new Intent(context, MyAuthCanceledHandlerActivity.class);
service.performAuthorizationRequest(
    req,
    PendingIntent.getActivity(context, req.hashCode(), postAuthIntent, 0),
    PendingIntent.getActivity(context, req.hashCode(), authCanceledIntent, 0));
```

### Handling the Redirect
We are using a custom scheme to send the OAuth redirect back to app. The library 
configures the `RedirectUriReceiverActivity` to handle a custom scheme and need to declare 
this activity into your `AndroidManifest.xml` file by adding following:

```xml
    <activity android:name="net.openid.appauth.RedirectUriReceiverActivity">
        <intent-filter>
            <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW"/>
            <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT"/>
            <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE"/>
            <data android:scheme="YOUR_CUSTOM_SCHEME"
                android:host="YOUR_REDIRECT_HOST"/>
        </intent-filter>
    </activity>
```

After completing authorization in custom tab, above custom scheme will redirect back 
to app.

When the response is captured by `RedirectUriReceiverActivity`, it is ultimately 
forwarded to the activity specified in your completion intent, and can be extracted 
from the intent data:

```java
public void onCreate(Bundle b) {
  // ...
  AuthorizationResponse resp = AuthorizationResponse.fromIntent(getIntent());
  AuthorizationException ex = AuthorizationException.fromIntent(getIntent());
  if (resp != null) {
    // authorization succeeded
  } else {
    // authorization failed, check ex for more details
  }
  // ...
}
```

The full redirect URI is also provided in your completion intent:

```java
public void onCreate(Bundle b) {
  // ...
  Uri redirectUri = getIntent().getData();
  // ...
}
```

Given the auth response, a token request can be created to exchange the 
authorization code:

```java
service.performTokenRequest(
    resp.createTokenExchangeRequest(),
    new AuthorizationService.TokenResponseCallback() {
      @Override public void onTokenRequestCompleted(
            TokenResponse resp, AuthorizationException ex) {
          if (resp != null) {
            // exchange succeeded
          } else {
            // authorization failed, check ex for more details
          }
        }
    });
```

If a confidential client is created through dynamic registration, and
the server expects the client to authenticate at the token endpoint,
the necessary client authentication must be supplied in the token
request. This can be simplified by making sure to store the registration
response in the `AuthState` instance, then
`AuthState::getClientAuthentication` can construct the necessary client
authentication:

```java
service.performTokenRequest(
    resp.createTokenExchangeRequest(),
    state.getClientAuthentication(),
    new AuthorizationService.TokenResponseCallback() {
      @Override public void onTokenRequestCompleted(
            TokenResponse resp, AuthorizationException ex) {
          if (resp != null) {
            // exchange succeeded
          } else {
            // authorization failed, check ex for more details
          }
        }
    });
```
### Making API Calls

With an updated AuthState based on the token exchange, it is then possible to
make requests using guaranteed fresh tokens at any future point:

```java
AuthState state = readAuthState();
state.performActionWithFreshTokens(service, new AuthStateAction() {
  @Override public void execute(
      String accessToken,
      String idToken,
      AuthorizationException ex) {
    if (ex != null) {
      // negotiation for fresh tokens failed, check ex for more details
      return;
    }

    // use the access token to do something ...
  }
});
```
